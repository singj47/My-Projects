The repository conatins all the major projects that were given by the university.
# Django Project
It was made in first year where we were supposed to make a social media platform using django,CSS,HTML and a bit of javascript.
# NASM project
This was project was done in second year where we were told to write a 64 bit NASM program. The program was to behave like a python program that computes the border array
of the input string and displays it in a simple way(as array of numbers).
